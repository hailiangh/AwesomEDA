### OpenPARF
- [GitHub](https://github.com/PKU-IDEA/OpenPARF) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16665)
- Summary: OpenPARF is an open-source FPGA placement and routing framework built upon the deep learning toolkit PyTorch. It is designed to be flexible, efficient, and extensible.
- Benchmark: ISPD 2016 FPGA Placement Benchmarks, ISPD 2017 FPGA Placement Benchmarks.

### Nextpnr
- [GitHub](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1903/1903.10407.pdf)
- Summary: nextpnr aims to be a vendor neutral, timing driven, FOSS FPGA place and route tool. There is some work in progress towards support for Xilinx devices but it is not upstream and not intended for end users at the present time.
- Benchmark: N/A
